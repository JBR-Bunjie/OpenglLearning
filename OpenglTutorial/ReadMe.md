## Update 20/2/2023

### finish items:

- project fixed
- solve the problem of class( From "BasicLight" to LightDirectional)
- achieve the LightDirectional

### Problems:

- the callback function we defined before broken, what's more weired is that the old project cannot work fine too

### The next step:

- we may just skip the DotLight and just move into the chapter three, because what we want to learn here is the theories behind. Not the opengl itself.

```cpp
// 10/2/2023: I cannot use the keycallback function well
// it just works for a very short time! even the old versions have the same problem.
// I suppose the OS is broken
// anyway, i will keep work on without these callback funs.
// And i change the move_speed extremely high
```
